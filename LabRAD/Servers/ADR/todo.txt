TODO LIST
- figure out fridge settings
- GGG temp monitoring
- do we want to have a recording checkbox with a time interval?
- try running some of this from dif computers
- ADRClient should get settings path and limits from ADRServer
- need to be able to open multiple ADR servers at the same time to control two ADRs simultaneously
- mag up buttons when adr server is not active give error
- mag up buttons should be updated with the updateState cycle so they get updated if client is opened later


QUESTIONS
+ how can I access the LABRADNODE env variable any time? THISLABRAD should be deleted
- why does the refreshing on a gpib added message not work?
- is it possible to overwrite an existing @setting? ==> yes, but method name and id need to be same

INSTRUCTIONS TO OPEN ADR PROGRAM
open labrad, click run
open node server in 'start' folder
open adr server
open adr client

BUGS
- Regulate seems to ignore temperature
- Cannot regulate to higher temperatures
- Regulation doesn't seem to really work at all outside of just dropping all the way to base temperature
