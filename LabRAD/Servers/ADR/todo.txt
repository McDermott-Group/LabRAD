TODO LIST
- &&& means todo in code
- figure out fridge settings
- GGG temp monitoring
- do we want to have a recording checkbox with a time interval?
- try running some of this from dif computers
- mag up buttons should be updated with the updateState cycle so they get updated if client is opened later
- make the startup scripts check what is already open before opening again
- make the startup scripts fully automated
- when automated startup, add interface to see different windows to ADRClient (so we can check what is working)
- Add open/close HS to mag up/reg buttons
+ ADR is selected from  beginning in client.  what if none are started first?
- add compressor controls

BUGS
- changing the regulation temp automatically starts regulation
- sometimes starting regulation doesnt decrease properly (I think due to dT=0)
- mag up buttons when adr server is not active give error
- changing the temperature does not seem to work
- since current lags voltage, often will mag all the way down.  have to press regulate again to go back up
- temperature logging inevitably fails after a while
- uses lots of memory
- selecting an ADR from menu when that ADR does not exist causes errors

TODO IN GENERAL
Data - either write a new datavault server or (hopefully) just use the existing one and change Ivan's code to use it
Grapher - make an universal plotting tool that is detangled from the experiment (sweep) code or use existing Grapher whatever is best (the decision on project "Data" should me made with this in mind).
Units - improve labrad.units module.


QUESTIONS
+ how can I access the LABRADNODE env variable any time? THISLABRAD should be deleted
- why does the refreshing on a gpib added message not work?
- is it possible to overwrite an existing @setting? ==> yes, but method name and id need to be same
