TODO LIST
- figure out fridge settings
- GGG temp monitoring
- do we want to have a recording checkbox with a time interval?
- try running some of this from dif computers
- should not be able to mag up when it is warm
- ADRClient should get settings path and limits from ADRServer
- need to be able to open multiple ADR servers at the same time to control two ADRs simultaneously
- for some reason, if the FAA is returning nan, the if statement in regulate to check if it is nan does not work
- when the time selection menu changes, refresh right then, don't wait for next signal

QUESTIONS
+ how can I access the LABRADNODE env variable any time? THISLABRAD should be deleted
- why does the refreshing on a gpib added message not work?
- is it possible to overwrite an existing @setting? ==> yes, but method name and id need to be same
