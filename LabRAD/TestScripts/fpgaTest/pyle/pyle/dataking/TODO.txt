Things to do to improve dataking experience

Improve sequence building method so that you can just tack on gates in a series

Fix registry wrappers so that they don't have attribute style access because we don't need this!

s is a pyle.registry.RegsitryWrapper. This item is just something that knows how to get/set
registry items. It is in not a subclass of dict. Although the __getitem__/__setitem__ methods
give it a dict-like interface, this is done entirely through dynamic calls to the registry
server. When you __getitem__ a registry subdirectory, a new RegistryWrapper wrapping only the
subdirectory is returned. Think of RegistryWrapper as a pointer than can __getitem__ new pointers.

Hook in for plotting of sequence envelopes!

Fix fpgaseq so that it doesn't suck!

Clean up qubitpulsecal: move parts into dstools, fitting
